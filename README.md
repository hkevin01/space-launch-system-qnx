# QNX-Based Space Launch System Simulation

A high-fidelity real-time simulation of a space launch system using QNX Neutrino RTOS, designed to emulate real-time conditions, subsystem communication, and fault-tolerant behavior for pre-launch and ascent operations.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates the key components of a space launch platform including:

- **Flight Control Computer (FCC)** - Primary flight control and navigation
- **Engine Control System** - Propulsion management and throttle control
- **Telemetry & Communications** - Data collection and ground communication
- **Environmental Monitoring** - Temperature, pressure, and vibration sensors
- **Ground Support Interface** - Mission control integration

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system leverages QNX Neutrino RTOS features:

- **Microkernel Architecture** - Inter-process communication (IPC) among subsystems
- **Resource Managers** - Priority scheduling for real-time constraints
- **Fault Isolation** - Redundant system design for safety-critical operations
- **Deterministic Execution** - Predictable timing for mission-critical tasks
